# Treasure-Hunter-Game_python
This is my assignment 5 for CMPT 120.

The game is played on a board (square matrix) with integer numbers in each board cell. 
The board represents a diamond mine with tunnels and special passages.
The numbers represent the number of diamonds in each cell location.
Each time a new game starts the user provides the name for the treasure hunter and the values to create the board.
Each game may allow a hunter to do many "treasure trips".
The users can play as many games as he/she wants with a different hunter each game.

The user will require to:
  
    Run the program in Python 2.7 IDE
    Provide an input for the hunter's name
    Provide values to create a board
 
The game will then proceed.
The game specification is provided in more details in the assig5-explorer-diamonds.pdf.
Please refer to this file in the repo for more information.
